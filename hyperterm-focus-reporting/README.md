# hyperterm-focus-reporting

This tiny hyperterm plugin to add focus-gained and focus-lost reporting to hyperterm.  This enables focus gained and focus lost in vim for autosave on blur.

## why?

This is mostly to support my own workflow which is terminal -> tmux -> vim.  I use [vitality](https://github.com/sjl/vitality.vim) with vim to handle most of this work.  Vitality works "out of the box" with iterm2.  I want the same functionality with hyperterm because iterm2 doesn't work on linux and hyperterm is nifty!

## install

```
cd ~/.hyperterm_plugins
npm i -S hyperterm-focus-reporting
```

Then add the plugin to your plugins section in `~/.hyperterm.js`

Add the following line to your `.vimrc` file:

```
let g:vitality_always_assume_iterm = 1
```

That's all there is to it.
